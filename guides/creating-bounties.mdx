## Bounty details

### Writing a good title

Keep it clear and specific:

<CodeGroup>

```text Good

```


```text Bad

```

</CodeGroup>

### Description best practices

Include:

- **Problem statement**: What's broken or needed
- **Context**: Why this matters
- **Technical details**: Stack, versions, environment
- **Expected outcome**: What success looks like

Example:

```markdown
## Problem
Users are experiencing timeout errors when logging in via mobile app.

## Context
This affects ~20% of iOS users on version 2.1.0. Error occurs after 
entering credentials but before reaching the dashboard.

## Technical details
- iOS app version 2.1.0
- Backend API: Node.js + Express
- Auth: JWT tokens with 15min expiry

## Expected outcome
- Login completes within 3 seconds
- No timeout errors
- Existing sessions remain valid
- Unit tests included
```

### Setting the right reward

Consider:

- **Complexity**: How difficult is the task?
- **Time required**: Hours or days of work?
- **Urgency**: Need it faster? Pay more.
- **Market rate**: What do similar bounties pay?

<Tip>
  Start with $100-$500 for small tasks, $500-$2000 for medium features, and \$2000+ for complex projects.
</Tip>
