## Payment methods

### Adding funds (creators)

- **Credit card**: Visa, Mastercard, American Express
- Instant processing
- 2.9% + \$0.30 processing fee

### Receiving payouts (developers)

- **ACH bank transfer**: Direct deposit to your bank
- 1-2 business days
- No fees

## Fees

### Platform fees

| Role      | Fee | When charged           |
| --------- | --- | ---------------------- |
| Creator   | 5%  | When bounty is created |
| Developer | 0%  | No fees on payouts     |

<Tip>
  Developers keep 100% of the bounty amount. Creators pay a 5% platform fee.
</Tip>

### Payment processing fees

Additional fees from payment providers:

- **Credit card**: 2.9% + \$0.30

### Example calculation

For a \$500 bounty:

```
Bounty amount:        $500.00
Platform fee (5%):    $ 25.00
Card processing:      $ 15.20
─────────────────────────────
Total charged:        $540.20

Developer receives:   $500.00
```

## Payment security

### How payment protection works

1. **Funds secured**: When you create a bounty, funds are held securely in our platform account
2. **Protected**: Neither party can access funds until work is approved
3. **Released**: Funds transfer instantly upon approval
4. **Refunded**: If bounty is cancelled, funds return to creator

### Dispute resolution

If there's a disagreement:

1. **Communicate**: Try to resolve directly with the other party
2. **Request mediation**: Contact [support@bounty.new](mailto:support@bounty.new)
3. **Review process**: Our team reviews the work and requirements
4. **Decision**: Funds released based on fair assessment

<Warning>
  Disputes are rare but taken seriously. Provide clear requirements upfront to avoid issues.
</Warning>
