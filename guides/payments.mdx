<Tip>Developers keep 100% of the bounty amount. Creators pay a 5% platform fee.</Tip>

### Payment processing fees

Additional fees from payment providers:

- **Credit card**: 2.9% + $0.30
- **Bank transfer**: 1% or $5 minimum
- **Crypto**: Network gas fees (varies)

### Example calculation

For a $500 bounty:

```
Bounty amount:        $500.00
Platform fee (5%):    $ 25.00
Card processing:      $ 15.20
─────────────────────────────
Total charged:        $540.20

Developer receives:   $500.00
```

## Fund protection and security

### How fund protection works

1. **Funds locked**: When you create a bounty, funds are held securely
2. **Protected**: Neither party can access funds until work is approved
3. **Released**: Funds transfer instantly upon approval
4. **Refunded**: If bounty is cancelled, funds return to creator

### Dispute resolution

If there's a disagreement:

1. **Communicate**: Try to resolve directly with the other party
2. **Request mediation**: Contact support@bounty.new
3. **Review process**: Our team reviews the work and requirements
4. **Decision**: Funds released based on fair assessment

<Warning>Disputes are rare but taken seriously. Provide clear requirements upfront to avoid issues.</Warning>
