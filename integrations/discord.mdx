## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bot not responding to commands">
    Ensure the bot has permissions to read messages and send messages in the channel. Check that you're using `/` slash commands, not `!` prefix commands.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't create bounties">
    Verify you have the required role permissions set in `/bounty permissions`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Notifications not appearing">
    Run `/bounty setup` again and ensure you've selected a valid notification channel.
