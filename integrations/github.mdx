## Creating bounties from issues

### Option 1: Add a label

Add the `bounty` label to any issue to automatically create a bounty. Set the amount in the issue description:

```markdown
## Bounty: $250

Fix the authentication bug described below...
```

### Option 2: Use a comment

Comment on any issue with:

```
/bounty $250
```

The bounty.new bot will create a bounty and link it to the issue.

### Option 3: Create from dashboard

Create a bounty in your dashboard and link it to an existing GitHub issue.

## Automatic payouts

When a PR that closes a bounty issue is merged:

1. The bounty.new bot detects the merge
2. Verifies the PR author
3. Processes the payout automatically
4. Comments on the issue with confirmation

<Tip>Use "Closes #123" or "Fixes #123" in your PR description to link it to the bounty issue.</Tip>

## Bounty status tracking

The bot updates issue comments with bounty status:

- 🎯 **Open**: Bounty is available
- 👀 **In Progress**: Someone is working on it
- ✅ **Completed**: PR merged, payout processed
- ❌ **Closed**: Bounty cancelled

## Configuration options

### Auto-approval

Enable auto-approval for merged PRs:

```yaml
# .github/bounty.yml
auto_approve: true
min_approvals: 2  # Require 2 PR approvals before payout
```

### Default amounts

Set default bounty amounts by label:

```yaml
bounty_amounts:
  bug: 100
  feature: 500
  critical: 1000
```

### Contributor requirements

Require contributors to meet certain criteria:

```yaml
requirements:
  min_account_age_days: 30
  min_contributions: 5
```

## Managing submissions

### Claiming a bounty

Developers comment on the issue:

```
/bounty claim
```

This marks the bounty as "In Progress" and assigns them.

### Submitting work

Create a PR that references the issue:

```markdown
Fixes #123

Implementation details...
```

### Reviewing submissions

Review the PR as normal. When merged, the payout is automatic. To manually approve:

```
/bounty approve @username
```

## Webhooks

Bounty.new sends webhooks for:

- Bounty created from issue
- Bounty claimed
- PR submitted
- Payout processed

Configure webhook URLs in your dashboard under Settings > Integrations > GitHub > Webhooks.

  <Accordion title="Bounty not created from issue">
    Ensure the `bounty` label exists in your repository and the GitHub app is installed with proper permissions.

  <Accordion title="Payout not processed after merge">
    Verify the PR description includes "Closes #[issue-number]" and the issue has an active bounty.
