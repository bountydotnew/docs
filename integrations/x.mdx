## Overview

The X integration lets you post bounties as tweets, reach a wider audience, and manage submissions through direct messages or replies.

## Prerequisites

- A bounty.new account
- An X (Twitter) account

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your X account">
    Go to your [bounty.new dashboard](https://bounty.new/dashboard) and navigate to Integrations > X.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize bounty.new">
    Click **Connect X Account** and authorize the app to post on your behalf.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure posting preferences">
    Choose whether to auto-post new bounties or manually share them.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating bounties from X

### Option 1: Post from dashboard

Create a bounty in your dashboard and click **Share on X** to automatically post it as a tweet.

### Option 2: Tweet with hashtag

Tweet your bounty with the `#bountynew` hashtag:

```
🎯 New bounty: Fix authentication bug in our API

💰 Reward: $500
⏰ Deadline: 7 days

Apply: https://bounty.new/b/[id]

#bountynew #developer #bug
```

The bounty.new bot will automatically detect and create the bounty.

## Managing submissions

Developers can:
- Reply to your tweet with their submission
- DM you their work
- Submit directly on bounty.new

You'll receive notifications for all submissions and can approve them from your dashboard.
